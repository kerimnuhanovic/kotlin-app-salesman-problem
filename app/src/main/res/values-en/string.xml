        The application contains sections where you can add cities with latitudes and lognitudes.
        It also allows you to print the largest path from the home city (the city that was added first) and other cities.
        It also allows you to view additional information about the city, and view the city on a map.
        After calculating the shortest route, it is also possible to display this route on a map.</string>
